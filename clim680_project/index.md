# Fidelity of circulation regimes and atmospheric rivers at different resolutions

## Mary Korendyke

My Clim680 project investigates the relationship between atmospheric rivers and precipitation over the North America. I choose this topic because my research is looking into how enhanced resolution influences atmospheric river representation for different circulation regimes.
